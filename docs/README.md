## Sections

- `adr/` - architecture decision records
- `architecture/` - repository shape, firmware boundaries, roadmap
- `examples/` - operator-facing config examples and future captured fixtures
- `harness/` - how AI agents are expected to work in this repo
- `questions/` - unresolved product and technical decisions
- `research/` - vendor facts, provider notes, reference-project analysis

## Minimum Document Set For Continuing Firmware Work

- `docs/architecture/runtime-scheduler.md`
- `docs/architecture/sleep-schedule-and-manual-wake.md`
- `docs/architecture/provisioning-and-config.md`
- `docs/architecture/serial-config-protocol.md`
- `docs/architecture/provider-abstraction.md`
- `docs/architecture/ui-home-screen-proposal.md`
- `docs/harness/testing-and-validation.md`
- `docs/research/decisions/framework-evaluation.md`
- `docs/research/decisions/display-library-evaluation.md`
- `docs/research/decisions/esp-idf-vs-arduino.md`

- `docs/questions/decision-checklist.md`

## Writing Rules

- Prefer stable facts over speculation.
- When a claim comes from a vendor example or reference repo, name the source path.
- Promote only durable decisions into `adr/`.
- Keep provider-specific details out of architecture docs when possible.
- Keep board-specific details out of provider docs when possible.
- When validated implementation changes behavior, update the matching docs in the same task.
